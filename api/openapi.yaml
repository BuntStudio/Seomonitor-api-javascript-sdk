  description: "`Introduction`\n\nThe SEOmonitor API allows you to programmatically\
    \ access keyword ranking, traffic, and other SEO data from the SEOmonitor platform.\
    \ You can use the API to build custom reports, automate workflows, and integrate\
    \ SEOmonitor data into your own applications.\nThe API enables free and unrestricted\
    \ access to all your data in the platform, for all Tracked Campaigns. Additionally,\
    \ it provides access to SEOmonitor's curated UK and US keyword database. \n\n\
    `Main Capabilities`\n\nThese are the main data sets you can retrieve with the\
    \ API 3.0 endpoints:\n\n`Campaign-level data`: Campaign details and campaign-wide\
    \ keyword data, landing page data, groups data, traffic data, content opportunities\
    \ data, forecast data, or campaign website research data.\n\n`Keyword-level data`:\
    \ Data for any and all keywords in the campaign, including ranking data, search\
    \ data, SERP data, competitor data, SEO Opportunity, keyword-level traffic data,\
    \ content optimization opportunities' data by keyword and keyword-level forecast\
    \ projections data.\n\n`Keyword group-level data`: Data for any keyword group\
    \ in the campaign, including aggregated search and SERP data, website Visibility\
    \ on specific groups, group SEO Opportunity data.\n\n`Landing page-level data`:\
    \ Data for specific landing pages that are ranking with the keywords in the campaign,\
    \ including aggregated search and SERP data, SEO Opportunity, and landing page\
    \ Visibility.\n\n`Organic traffic data`: Data for the website's organic sessions,\
    \ conversions, and revenue, including traffic data by segments (brand, non-brand,\
    \ all traffic, and custom user-created traffic segments), by specific keywords\
    \ and by specific landing pages.\n\n`Keyword & website research data`: Data for\
    \ any keyword in SEOmonitor's Research database – any domain-level aggregated\
    \ search, SERP, and ranking data, and keyword-level and keyword list-level metrics,\
    \ for the tracked website and for any competitor in top 100.\n\n`Forecast data`:\
    \ Overview data and details for specific Forecast Scenarios and Objectives, and\
    \ keyword-level forecast data.\n\n`Website content data`: Data related to content\
    \ optimization opportunities of the tracked website, including landing page and\
    \ keyword data for each of the content opportunities categories in SEOmonitor's\
    \ Content Audit platform (Positive and negative correlations with Visibility,\
    \ Cannibalization issues, Pages serving too many keywords, Keywords with missing\
    \ pages, Suboptimal keyword inclusion in the title or H1 or page content, Pages\
    \ with missing title or H1).\n\n\n`Getting Started`\n\nLog into your SEOmonitor\
    \ account and retrieve your unique API Token (Account Settings > Edit Profile).\n\
    \nCheck out the `quick start guide` to make your first API call.\n\nRead through\
    \ the `authentication guide` to learn how to properly authenticate your API requests.\n\
    \n\n`Libraries and SDKs`\n\nSEOmonitor API uses HTTP protocol, which allows the\
    \ application of our API to almost all programming languages. All the responses\
    \ are returned in JSON format by default.\n\nFor convenience, we offer client\
    \ libraries for popular programming languages:\n\nJavaScript\nPHP\nPython\nJava\n\
    \n\n`Support`\n\nNeed help using the API, or have general inquiries? Please contact\
    \ our support team.\n\nFor more information about the SEOmonitor platform, you\
    \ can visit www.seomonitor.com.\n\n\n`Changelog`\n\n    This is the first version\
    \ of API 3.0. The Changelog page will be updated as we continue to develop new\
    \ features and improvements.\n\n\n\n\n`Quick Start Guide`\n\nThis guide will walk\
    \ you through making your first API call.\n\n`Get your API key`\n\nFirst, you'll\
    \ need to get an API key:\n\n    1. Log in to your SEOmonitor account (https://app.seomonitor.com)\n\
    \    2. Go to Account Settings > Edit Profile\n    3. Copy the API Token to use\
    \ in your API requests\n\nNote: Clicking `Regenerate API Token` will overwrite\
    \ the current key and you will lose access if you or other users are currently\
    \ using it.\n\n\n`Make a request`\n\nNext, we'll use cURL to make a request to\
    \ get Tracked Campaigns details:\n\n    curl --request GET \\\n    --url https://apix.seomonitor.com/dashboard/v3.0/campaigns/tracked\
    \ \\\n    --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n    --header 'Authorization:\
    \ eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzZW9tb25pdG9yLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY1Mjc4NTcwNCwidXNlcl9pZCI6IjY2NTI5In0.2_l9e7ohs9QHbwmr48mIoEF-QxZHNPFiAzJbMk00jcA'\n\
    \nThis will retrieve the Tracked Campaigns data for an SEOmonitor account having\
    \ the following API Token:\n\n    'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzZW9tb25pdG9yLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTY1Mjc4NTcwNCwidXNlcl9pZCI6IjY2NTI5In0.2_l9e7ohs9QHbwmr48mIoEF-QxZHNPFiAzJbMk00jcA'\n\
    \n\nLet's break down the parts of the request:\n\n    - `--request GET` - Make\
    \ a GET request\n    - `--url` - The API endpoint URL\n    - `--header` - Adds\
    \ the Authorization header with your API key\n\n\nHandle the response\n\nThe API\
    \ will return a JSON response like this:\n\n    {\n      \"campaign_info\": {\n\
    \        \"id\": \"74516\",\n        \"name\": \"Asos.com\", \n        \"company\"\
    : \"Asos\",\n        \"company_id\": \"51256\",\n        \"domain\": \"www.asos.com\"\
    ,\n        \"keyword_count\": 588, \n        \"date_created\": \"2023-04-25\"\
    ,\n        \"location\": \"United Kingdom\",\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n\
    \        \"mrr\": 3000\n      },\n      \"visibility\": {\n        \"desktop\"\
    : {\n          \"latest\": 0.28,\n          \"trend_7days\": 0.2,\n          \"\
    trend_30days\": 0.2\n        },\n        \"mobile\": {\n          \"latest\":\
    \ 0.27, \n          \"trend_7days\": 0.2,\n          \"trend_30days\": 0.2\n \
    \       }\n      },\n      \"multiple_locations\": [\n        {\n          \"\
    campaign_id\": 12746,\n          \"location\": \"London, United Kingdom\",\n \
    \         \"visibility\": {\n            \"desktop\": {\n              \"latest\"\
    : 0.32,\n              \"trend_7days\": 0.02\n              \"trend_30days: 0.1\n\
    \              },\n            \"mobile\": {\n              \"latest\": 0.33,\n\
    \              \"trend\": 0.03\n              \"trend_30days\": 0.1  \n      \
    \        }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"health_status\"\
    : \"healthy\",\n      \"objective_status\": {\n        \"actual_sessions\": 78400,\n\
    \        \"estimated_sessions\": 78400,  \n        \"performance\": 1,\n     \
    \   \"status\": \"on_track\",\n        \"start_month\": \"Jun, 2023\", \n    \
    \    \"end_month\": \"Jul, 2024\"\n      },\n      \"reporting_status\": \"submitted\"\
    ,\n      \"account_manager\": \"Jo Hart\"\n    }\n\nAnd that's it! You just made\
    \ your first API call. Check out the rest of the API reference documentation to\
    \ see what else you can build.\n\n`Best practices`\n\n    - Keep your API key\
    \ private – do not share your key publicly.\n    - Do not include your key directly\
    \ in code that you distribute – use environment variables instead.\n    - Regenerate\
    \ your key periodically for improved security.\n    - Limit API key access to\
    \ only required endpoints if possible.\n\n`Revoking API keys`\n\nIf your API key\
    \ is compromised, you can revoke it by regenerating the API Token in your SEOmonitor\
    \ Account Settings. This will immediately invalidate the current key so further\
    \ requests can't be made.\n\nFor any other issues with authentication, contact\
    \ our support team.\n\n\n`Retrieve the IDs of the company, campaigns, keywords\
    \ and keyword groups`\n\nThe unique IDs of your company, campaigns, keywords,\
    \ or keyword groups can be retrieved either from the specific URLs of the platform,\
    \ or from specific API endpoint responses. Further below you'll find details on\
    \ these alternatives.\n\n\n`Company ID`\n\nThe company ID can only be retrieved\
    \ from the platform. Follow these steps:\n\n    1. Log in to your SEOmonitor account\

    \ In the Billing section, the platform URL contains the company ID.\n    E.g.:\
